This portfolio contains projects I've been working on in the past that reflect some of my skills

Be informed that none of these projects made it to release for different reasons, so some bugs and unexpected interactions might come up

List of included projects:

- AEGIS (UI with minimal interaction). AI powered image segmentation GIS, intended for use by cartographers to allow for more efficient workflow. Only presented as a frontend with no server interactivity
- Audarmasy (Basic UI implementation only). Kazakh-Russian dictionary website. This is a work in progress project with many changes to come in the future

- some backend is available to see as source code
